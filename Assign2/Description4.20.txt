Modify programming problem Exercise 3.20 from Chapter 3, which asks
you to design a pid manager. This modification will consist of writing
a multithreaded program that tests your solution to Exercise 3.20. You
will create a number of threads—for example, 100—and each threadwill
request a pid, sleep for a randomperiod of time, and then release the pid.
(Sleeping for a random period of time approximates the typical pid usage
in which a pid is assigned to a new process, the process executes and
then terminates, and the pid is released on the process’s termination.) On
UNIX and Linux systems, sleeping is accomplished through the sleep()
function, which is passed an integer value representing the number of
seconds to sleep.
